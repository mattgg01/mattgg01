### Hello! My name is Matt ðŸ‘‹

From a young age scripting in the LUA language, to today practicing Full Stack Web Development, I have a driving passion for writing code and a strong feeling of reward to solve real world problems.

I am a full stack web developer but focus on creating back end databases and data aggregation with a passion for scalability.
